# First Django application: a blog

This repository is the result of me taking part in a hand-on workshop celebrated in 2019's PyDay. The workshop was organized by Django Girls Barcelona.

It was my first time seeing the insides of a Django application and the different steps involved in creating it.

It is a work in progress as I did not finished that day. I still need to beautify it with css.
